# ZORK Implementation in MINT

## Overview
Zork is a classic text adventure game, notable for its storytelling and puzzles. This MINT-based version uses structured arrays and 16-bit integer operations to simulate a text adventure. This implementation includes fundamental components such as player input parsing, game state management, and world navigation.

## Game Components
1. **Game State**  
   - Define 16-bit integer variables for player attributes like `health`, `location`, and `inventory`.
   - Use MINT’s carry flag `/c` to assist with managing overflow during complex calculations, such as health or inventory updates.

2. **World Representation**  
   - Use arrays to represent rooms and objects:
     - Each room array holds data on room descriptions, exits, and items.
     - Object arrays include name, location, and description.
   - Example:
     ```mint
     :DefineRoom `Room Name` `Description` [ exits ] [ items ] ;
     ```
   - Rooms are cross-referenced through their array indices, establishing the map layout.

3. **Player Input**  
   - Implement a simple parser using conditionals to interpret commands.  
   - Example commands: `go`, `take`, `drop`, `look`.
   - MINT Example:
     ```mint
     :ParseInput /K (code to check and route command) ;
     ```

4. **Game Flow**  
   - Main game loop repeatedly checks for input, processes it, and updates the state.
   - Win/loss conditions are tracked by specific variables (e.g., `goalAchieved`, `playerDead`).
   - Example:
     ```mint
     :GameLoop ParseInput UpdateState CheckConditions ;
     ```

5. **Puzzles and Challenges**  
   - Implement puzzle logic through conditional checks and specific player actions.
   - Puzzles might involve item collection or sequence completion to progress.

6. **Storytelling**  
   - Display room descriptions and narrative based on `location` and story progression.
   - Use literals for storytelling within MINT's constraints on text length:
     ```mint
     `You are in a dark room with an exit to the north.`
     ```

7. **Inventory Management**  
   - Use an array to store inventory items, managing addition and removal of items.
   - Example:
     ```mint
     :TakeItem (code to add item to inventory) ;
     :DropItem (code to remove item from inventory) ;
     ```

8. **Interactions**  
   - Enable interactions with non-player characters (NPCs) through dialogue and choice-based events.
   - Store NPC states in variables and use conditions to manage their responses.

9. **Saving and Loading**  
   - Use MINT's variable storage to manually save player state (e.g., `health`, `location`) and load on restart.

10. **Error Handling**  
    - Implement default responses for invalid commands or actions.
    - Example:
      ```mint
      :InvalidCommand `I don't understand that.` ;
      ```

## Code Example Outline
```mint
:M 0 health! 0 location! GameLoop ;                  // Main entry point
:DefineRoom `Start Room` [1 0 0 0] [10 0 0] ;       // Define starting room
:ParseInput /K (parse logic) ;                       // Input handling
:GameLoop ParseInput UpdateState CheckConditions ;   // Main game loop
:TakeItem (add item to inventory) ;
:DropItem (remove item from inventory) ;
:CheckConditions (check win/loss) ;
:InvalidCommand `I don't understand that.` ;
```

### Important Notes
- **Memory Management**: Use compact data structures to handle rooms and items within MINT’s memory limits.
- **Signed 16-Bit Integer Limitations**: Design calculations to avoid overflow, especially in complex arithmetic or inventory operations.
