# zork

Zork is a classic text-based adventure game that was originally developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It's known for its rich storytelling, intricate puzzles, and immersive world. While Zork was primarily implemented in various versions of the Inform programming language, I can provide you with a high-level explanation of the game's logic in Forth-83 using fixed-point 16-bit integers, as you requested.

In Forth-83, Zork's game logic would be implemented as a series of words (functions) that manipulate the game state, respond to player input, and manage the game world. Here's an overview of the key components of Zork's game logic:

1. Game State:
   - Create fixed-point 16-bit integer variables to represent various aspects of the game state, such as the player's inventory, current location, and health.
   - Use the carry flag for handling large numbers or complex calculations if necessary.

2. World Representation:
   - Define data structures to represent the game world, including rooms, objects, and characters.
   - Each room could be represented by a data structure containing information about its description, exits to other rooms, and items within it.
   - Objects and characters can also be represented as data structures with attributes like name, description, and location.

3. Player Input:
   - Implement a parser that interprets player input. In Forth-83, this might involve defining words to parse and understand user commands.
   - Handle a variety of player actions such as moving between rooms, examining objects, taking and dropping items, and interacting with characters.

4. Game Flow:
   - Use a game loop that continuously waits for player input, processes it, and updates the game state accordingly.
   - Implement logic for win and lose conditions, such as winning the game by achieving a specific goal or losing by dying or making certain mistakes.

5. Puzzles and Challenges:
   - Design puzzles and challenges that require the player to solve problems, collect items, and explore the game world.
   - Create words to handle puzzle solutions and progression in the game.

6. Storytelling:
   - Craft a compelling narrative by displaying descriptive text to the player as they explore the game world.
   - Use fixed-point 16-bit integers to track and modify story progress.

7. Inventory Management:
   - Allow the player to pick up, drop, and manage items in their inventory. Implement words for these actions.

8. Interactions:
   - Enable interactions between the player character and non-player characters, including dialogue and decision-making.

9. Saving and Loading:
   - Implement a way for players to save and load their progress within the game.

10. Error Handling:
    - Handle errors gracefully, providing helpful feedback to the player when they enter invalid commands or encounter issues.

This is a high-level overview of how you might implement Zork's game logic in Forth-83 with fixed-point 16-bit integers. In practice, creating a complete Zork-like game would require significant programming effort and attention to detail, as well as creative storytelling and puzzle design.


## code 
- aim for a text adventure structure,

issues and possible improvements.

- Forth-83 has a different memory management model compared to modern programming languages,
- so the code must respect the limitations of a 16-bit system
- particularly with regard to fixed-point arithmetic and memory allocation.

Let's address the issues and improve the code:

1. Forth does not support structures like higher-level languages. Instead, you define "fields" and calculate their memory offsets manually.
2. Forth does not have automatic garbage collection, so memory allocation (`ALLOCATE`) should be handled carefully to avoid memory leaks.
3. Interaction with the player should be handled in a more robust way, with better input parsing.
4. Fixed-point arithmetic is not utilized properly in the given code, and there are no operations where fixed-point would be necessary. For a text adventure, fixed-point might not be needed unless you are handling fractional values for scoring or similar.
5. There is no real "inventory system" implemented in the code.

code with fixes and improvements for the issues mentioned:


Improvements made:
- Replaced `STRUCTURE` with individual `VARIABLE` definitions to define room properties.
- Replaced `ALLOCATE` with `CREATE` and `CELLS ALLOT` to create a fixed-size inventory.
- Simplified the inventory to store item IDs as integers.
- Added a simple command switch for the game loop with options to quit and show inventory.
- Improved inventory display with `show-inventory`.
- Removed the `ADD-TO-INVENTORY` input prompt since it's not practical to ask the player every time. You would typically call `add-to-inventory` when an item is picked up in the game.
- Added comments for clarity.

Please note that a complete implementation of a game like Zork would be far more complex
